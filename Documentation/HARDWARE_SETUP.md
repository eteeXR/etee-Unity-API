# Hardware Setup

If this is your first time using the eteeControllers, please visit the [etee XR guide page][url-QSG-guides] for more information on the hardware setup. To interface with the etee Unity API library, you will need a pair of [eteeControllers][url-eteecontroller-shop] and one dongle (included with the eteeControllers).

## Controllers and eteeDongle Connection

Before starting with the etee Unity API, check the connection between your eteeControllers and eteeDongle.

First, **plug your eteeDongle** into your laptop or PC; when connected correctly, the LED indicator in the eteeDongle should consistently blink blue. If not, try re-plugging the eteeDongle.

Afterwards, **turn on your eteeController(s)**. Now, the eteeDongle should blink pink once if there is one eteeController connected to the eteeDongle, or twice if there are two eteeControllers connected. 
If the eteeDongle shows no connection with the eteeControllers, re-plug the dongle. You should also check that the eteeControllers and eteeDongle have compatible firmware versions.

## Firmware Versions

The device firmware versions required for this API are:
- **eteeDongle Firmware**: 1.1.7 or higher.
- **eteeController(s) Firmware**: 1.3.6 or higher.

Firmware for etee devices can be updated through the official etee Connect app, under the ‘*Settings ‣ Firmware*’ Section.
